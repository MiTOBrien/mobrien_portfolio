    description: My professional journey started in the military. After being honorably discharged I worked in a variety of IT positions including desktop/end user support, server support, and networking. My time in the military installed qualities such as communication, teamwork, and being a self-starter/self-motivated.  I've carried these skills over into all my jobs and seen the importance these skills have in the workplace. It was in one of my first IT positions for a small computer store in Grenada, MS. that I experienced the internet as we were also an ISP for our county and this sparked my passion for development. Seeing webpages online I immediately thought "I want to do that." This passion led to buying books and learning HTML on my own and then hosting some static websites online. I continued to fuel my passion with self-study using books and then online resources through sites like Udemy and PluralSight. I furthered enhanced and leveraged my skills writing custom Powershell tools for different teams to enhance their job performance. Due to a health issue with my wife I needed to step away from the workforce to provide care for her this allowed me to make a career transition.  I attended the Turing School of Software & Design to earn my certification in Full Stack Development.

    description: Outside of my professional career I am a road cyclist, an avid SCUBA diver holding almost every PADI recreational certification as well as my PADI Divemaster certification and have logged over 3,500 dives. I am also a competitive yoyo player, sponsored by Skill Addicts, and have competed 3 times at the FL State YoYo contest and attended the World YoYo contest in Clevland, OH in 2024. Cycling multiple century rides (100+ miles) has taught me perserverance, and the will to never give up when I set my mind to something and SCUBA diving and competitive yoyo have taught me to remain calm under pressure.
