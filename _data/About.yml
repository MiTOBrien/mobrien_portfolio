    description: My professional journey started in the military. After being honorably discharged I worked in a variety of IT positions including desktop/end user support, server support, and networking. It was in one of my first IT positionjs for a small computer store in Grenada, MS. that I experienced the internet as we were also an ISP for our county and this sparked my passion for development. Seeing webpages online I immediately thought "I want to do that." This led to buying books and learning HTML on my own and then hosting some static websites online. Through the years I continued self-study with books and then online resources through sites like Udemy and PluralSight. I furthered enhanced and leveraged my skills writing custom Powershell tools for different teams to enhance their job performance. Due to a health issue with my wife I needed to step away from the workforce to provide care for her this allowed me to make a career transition.  I attended the Turing School of Software & Design to earn my certification in Full Stack Development.
